Future Improvement Plans:
1) Future improvement plan could be to remove hard coding from the script. Currently the task names has been hard coded. The tasks names being referred to here are Install Selenium, Configure Selenium, Write Down the Test Cases, etc. These could be moved to a separate excel data  file which could get imported.
2) Include error handling as well. If the test fails it show throw out exception.
